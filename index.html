                <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                    Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
                    was born on October 15, 1931, in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.</li> 
                <li>He served as the 11th President
                    of India from 2002 to 2007.</li> 
                 <li>Kalam earned a degree in
                    aeronautical engineering from the
                    Madras Institute of Technology and in
                    1958 joined the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
                <li>In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation, where he
                    was project director of the SLV-III, the
                    first satellite launch vehicle that was
                    both designed and produced in India.</li>
                 <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                    Kalam planned the program that produced
                    a number of successful missiles, which
                    helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                        “Missile Man.”</strong></li> 
                <li>Among those successes
                    was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
                    ballistic missile, which incorporated
                    aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                    in 1989.</li>
